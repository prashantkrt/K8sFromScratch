#  Step1 Create the cluster:
=> kind create cluster --config 01-cluster.yaml

#  verify cluster
=> kubectl get nodes or kubectl get node

#  verify pod if any
=> kubectl get pods or kubectl get pods 

#  Better use watch command to check the status in fixed intervals
#  Runs a command repeatedly at a fixed interval (default: 2 seconds).
#  Useful for monitoring changes in real-time.
=> watch -t kubectl get pods (where -t is we don't need title bar)

#  create pod
=> kubectl create -f 01-simple-pod.yaml

#  verify
=> kubectl get pod

#  descibe basically to get all the events details and more information related to pods
=> kubectl describe pods       

#  delete pod
=> kubectl delete -f 01-simple-pod.yaml

# Pods Status :  
# Pending  => Node is yet to be assigned 
# ContainerCreating  => Kubelet is working on creating the container 
# Running  => Kubelet started the container 
# ErrImage / ImagePullBackOff => Failed pulling the image / Kubelet will try after some delays
# Completed => Container exited successfully
# Error => Container exited with some error
# CrashLoopBackOff => There is a problem in running the container. Kubelet is retrying with delays(no issue in pulling the image)  
# Terminating => Pod is getting deleted
