# The minReadySeconds field in a Kubernetes Deployment specifies the minimum number of seconds a newly created Pod should be in a 'ready' state before it is considered available for use.
#minReadySeconds: 10 means:
# After a pod is reported as Ready, Kubernetes will wait for 10 seconds before marking it as Available.
# This helps ensure that the pod is not just "quickly ready" and then fails â€” it's a stability check.
# The minReadySeconds can be very helpful in cases like database connections, where:

# => kubectl apply -f 05-min-ready-seconds.yaml 
# => kubectl get deploy/my-deployment , will be available after 10 seconds
# NAME            READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
# my-deployment   3/3     3            3           2m11s

# => kubectl delete deploy --all
