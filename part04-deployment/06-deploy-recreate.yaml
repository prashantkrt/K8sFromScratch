## Deployment Strategy!!
# 1. recreate => delete/terminate all the old pods and then create the new pods.
# In this strategy, all old Pods are killed first, then new Pods are created.   


#  RollingUpdate Strategy (Default) Kubernetes gradually replaces old Pods with new ones.
# 2. rolling update => gradually replace the old pods with new ones. Gradually rollout the changes. We can mix the old and new pods temporarily.
# For rolling update we have two properties:
# a. maxUnavailable: maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update process.
# b. maxSurge: maximum number of additional pods that can be created. Max extra pods allowed above desired replicas


# Say you have replicas: 3, here's what happens:
# Field	Value	Meaning
# maxSurge	1	Up to 4 pods can run temporarily
# maxUnavailable	1	At least 2 pods will always be running

# Say you have replicas: 3, here's what happens:
# Field	Value	Meaning
# maxSurge	3	Up to 6 pods can run temporarily
# maxUnavailable	3	Up to 3 Pods can be unavailable during the update â†’ even 0 running

# => kubectl delete deploy --all
# => kubectl apply -f 06-deploy-recreate.yaml
# => kubectl rollout history deploy/my-deployment
# REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
# 1         v1 version


# making changes to v2 
# => kubectl apply -f 06-deploy-recreate.yaml
# => kubectl rollout history deploy/my-deployment
# REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
# 1         v2 version  see completly deleted the old pods and created new ones and no old pods version is available


# => kubectl rollout undo deploy
# error: no rollout history found for deployment "my-deployment"
