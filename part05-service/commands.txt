# Services : 
# Logical abstraction for a set of pods
# Service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them
# Since Pods in Kubernetes are ephemeral (they can die and be replaced at any time), a Service helps you reliably communicate with the pods regardless of changes in their IP addresses.
# Ensures stable network identity for a set of pods.
# Handles load balancing across the matching pods.
# Allows service discovery within the cluster.
# Facilitates external access to your applications (via NodePort or LoadBalancer).

# A single reliable network endpoint to access the pods =>  a consistent way to access your Pods, even when individual Pods come and go.
# Stable IP addresses => A Pod IP is not reliable — it changes when the Pod restarts.
# DNS Name 

# Ek Mast example deta hu: 
# Imagine you’re running a hotel (your Kubernetes cluster) with many identical rooms (your Pods) where waiters (clients/microservices) need to deliver food to Room Service.
# But there's a problem:
# Rooms (Pods) change numbers every day (because Pods are ephemeral — they die and get recreated with new IPs). So, how can the waiters always find Room Service?
# The solution? Create a Service Desk (Kubernetes Service) with:


# => kubectl apply -f part05-service/01-simple-deploy.yaml

# Command to check the deployment
# => kubectl get deploy

# Command to check the pods
# => kubectl get pods

# Command to check the logs of the pod        
# => kubectl logs <pod-name>

# Command to check the events of the pod
# => kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

# Command to check the events of the deployment
# => kubectl describe deploy <deploy-name>

# Command to delete the deployment
# => kubectl delete deploy <deploy-name>

# Command to delete the pod
# => kubectl delete pod <pod-name>

# Command to delete all the resources in the namespace
# => kubectl delete all --all -n <namespace>
