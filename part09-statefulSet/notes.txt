StatefulSet:
  pod-0 -> volume-0
  pod-1 -> volume-1
  pod-2 -> volume-2

Basically each pod will have its own PV   
Each pod remembers who it is and has its own volume — even after deletion or rescheduling.

Pods are usually stateless.
If you use a PersistentVolume (PV) via a PVC, it can be:
Shared between pods (if access mode allows).
Or not used at all if the app doesn’t need it.
All pods share the same volume if they mount the same PVC.

In a StatefulSet:
Each pod gets its own unique PersistentVolume (PV).
Kubernetes automatically creates one PVC per pod using a volumeClaimTemplates.
That PVC is then backed by a unique PV, so:
pod-0 --> pvc-0 --> pv-0
pod-1 --> pvc-1 --> pv-1
pod-2 --> pvc-2 --> pv-2
